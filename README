This is my wallpaper. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My wallpaper is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My wallpaper, without me, is useless. Without my wallpaper, I am useless. I must choose my wallpaper epicly. I must pick smarter than my enemy who is trying to corrupt me. I must pick before him, before he succeeds. And I will.
